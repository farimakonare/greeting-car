# greeting-cards

Project Overview:
This project was about building a React app called Greeting Cards. The app has three main parts: a Header, a GreetingCard for showing messages, and an App to put everything together. I learned how to use React components, pass Properties , and style with Tailwind CSS.

Discussion:
This project helped me understand React better. I learned how to make components work together and fix errors with file imports and directories. Working with Tailwind CSS was not really difficult once everything was set up. # greeting-cards
